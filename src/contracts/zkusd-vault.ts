 * @notice  The vaults track users deposits of collateral in the form of MINA and debt in the form of zkUSD.
 *          The stablecoins peg is maintained by ensuring the vault always has more than 150% collateralization ratio. If the vault is undercollateralized,
 *          then anyone can liquidate the vault by repaying the debt within it. The liquidator will receive the collateral in return.
